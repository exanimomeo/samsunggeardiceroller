# Samsung Gear Dice Roller
Application intends to have a variable dice-rolling system, one that uses the gear to roll the dice, and have a select amount of dice of each kind used in the d20 ttrpg systems. The system will take the base dice (d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d20) involved in that system, and allow for a number of each of them. There will be a ui display of the dice rolling, rendered through a 2d graphic. The maximum displayed will vary depending on development, but will likely be less than 20. Additional bonuses could be enabled, as well as certain rules such as keep highest and rerolling.
